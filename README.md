# Quantum Kernel Ridge Regression (QKRR)

This repo contains the code for performing ridge regressions using kernels generated using quantum circuits.

Data Folder contains snapshots of Beryllium atom. The kernels were trained on the data present in input_snap subfolder and tested on the data present in output_density subfolder.
